# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# App Description

---

- The app is basically a job postings app which accepts users using a login form and then displays to the users available job postings when they are successfully logged in.

# Pages Description

---

- The app has two components, the

* Login page
* Home page

# Login Page

- The login page is the page that authenticates users and it is also a page that briefly welcomes users.
- When a user is not registered, there is the option for the user to register with the help of the register button on the page.

---

# Home Page

- The home page is a page that displays the job postings that are available. This page is a page that lists all jobs, their salary amounts and also their locations.

---

# Components Used

- In my project, some of the components I used include:

* FlatList: This component renders a list of items in an array.
* Button: This component created a button which can be clicked on. It was used for the Register button on the Login page.
* ScrollView: This component is used to make a page scrollable, thus, without it, a page with contents that overlaps the height of the window will not be seen.
* TextInput: The TextInput component is helpful and used in creating or accepting user inputs. This component was used in creating the input fields in the Login page.
